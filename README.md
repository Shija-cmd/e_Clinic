# e_Clinic
This is the project for integrating a machine learning model in the django framework system to predict the presence 
of STI in the patients.
The patient is required to enter the symptoms he is feeling by selecting from the drop-down menu and then hitting the button
submit.
How the system works
The information submitted by the patient into the system is processed by the ml model by finding the pattern and making 
decisions according to the training the model trained to predict whether there is the possibility of having infection or not.
# Some snapshots of the system.

The image above shows the page after the user (named Ella on this page) creates an account and login into the system
The user hits the button "Ingiza dalili unazohisi" in the navbar, it is a Swahili sentence that means enter the symptoms 
you are feeling. Then after entering the symptoms, the user hits the button labelled "wasilisha" means submit, and then the system
predicts if there is a possibility of having some infections. See the attachment below

The column named "Maambukizi" means infections, shows the prediction of either the possibility of having infections or having no 
infections
